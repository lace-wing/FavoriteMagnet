[h1]Item Magnet Pro, your choice of item magnet![/h1]

Item Magnet Pro is a quality-of-life mod which adds an item attraction system and an item for you to configure it.

[h3]With this mod, you can:[/h3]
- Attract all items
- Attract items marked as favorite only
- Attract items already in your inventory only
- And the inverses of all above!
- Enable a Encumbered effect, similar to the vanilla ENcumbering Stone but items attracted are NOT AFFECTED!
- Set a attraction delay (3s by default), pretty useful for MULTI-PLAYER MODE!
- Configure attraction range
- Use these features without an item taking up your inventory space

[h3]How to use:[/h3]
1. Get 4 Dirt Blocks, stand nearby a workbench (fairly easy to follow)
2. Craft an item called 'Item Magnet Pro'
3. Read it's tooltip and use it
