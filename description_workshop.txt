Item Magnet God (FavoriteMagnet) is a quality-of-life which adds an item attraction system and an item for you to configure it.

[h3]With this mod, you can:[/h3]
- Attract all items
- Attract items marked as favorite only
- Attract items already in your inventory only
- And the inverses of all above!
- Enable a Encumbered effect, similar to the vanilla ENcumbering Stone but items attracted are NOT AFFECTED!
- Set a attraction delay (3s by default), pretty useful for MULTI-PLAYER MODE!
- Configure attraction range
- Use these features without an item taking up your inventory space
