[h1]Item Magnet Pro, your choice of item magnet![/h1]

Item Magnet Pro is a quality-of-life mod which adds an item attraction system and an item for you to configure it.

[h2]Why This Magnet?[/h2]
- Easy to access
- Easy to toggle (with a few clicks)
- Easy to config (no spamming or confusing configs)
- Rich and powerful functionality (see section Functionality below)

[h3]Functionality[/h3]
- Attract all items
- Attract items marked as favorite only
- Attract items already in your inventory only
- And the inverses of all above!
- Vacancy check, so that you will not be spammed by tons of items
- Enable a Encumbered effect, similar to the vanilla ENcumbering Stone but items attracted are NOT AFFECTED!
- Exhaust all attracted items
- Set a attraction delay (2s by default), pretty useful in multi-player
- Configure attraction range

[h3]Guide[/h3]
1. Get 4 Dirt Blocks, stand nearby a workbench (fairly easy to follow)
2. Craft an item called 'Item Magnet Pro'
3. Read it's tooltip and use it
